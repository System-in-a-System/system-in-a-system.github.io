My name is Maryna.

I am a linguist and have been working with code systems of natural languages since 2010.

In 2019 I decided to take a level up and acquire a competence in code systems that have more pragmatic power. 

That is when I got involved in programming.

I enjoy how a programming language
is clean, cold, refined and devoid of connotative noise,
how its imperative power is close to absolute, as much as
its engineering potential. 

Having found myself in synergy with coding,
I decided to make it into my fulltime carrier
and become a software developer.

So now I am studying Software Development and Operations at Linnaeus University.
