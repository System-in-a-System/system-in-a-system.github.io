![jekyll-theme-image](/assets/pic/jekyll.png){:class="content-img"}

This website was generated with the help of a simple, extendable, static site generator "Jekyll" using its basic theme, minima-2.5.1, that was complemented with further styling adjustments. 

The website was generated for the course in Client-based Web Programming at Linnaeus University. 

The idea is that it will serve the front for my published assignments in this course and possibly in the courses to come.
