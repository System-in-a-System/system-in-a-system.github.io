humans.txt is a TXT file put in the site root folder that contains information about the contributors to the website (developers, designers, copywriters and so on).

Adding humans.txt file is an external and accessible way to claim your authorship. 

It is a nice and non-intrusive-with-the-code initiative for presenting the people that took part in the development process.

While developing this website I also added humans.txt to the site root folder (/src), where I then specified the author (me) and further details.
