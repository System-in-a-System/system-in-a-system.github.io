If you have ever tried to create a multipage website by writing HTML and CSS documents from scratch, you are most definitely familiar with that "oh crap" feeling just as you noticed a tiny spelling mistake in the header or a wrong link in the navigation. Whatever it is, if the global layout has been discovered to have faults, you have to reopen all(!) pages for corrections. The more pages you have, the more things you have to keep an eye on and at some point, it gets tedious.

This is at this point when static site generators are coming to the rescue!  

One of the most popular static site generators is Jekyll. 

Jekyll is a parsing engine that builds static websites from separate dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Working with separate dynamic components provides an opportunity to make global templates for many repetitive code blocks, which is a great productivity optimization, especially when you develop a multipage website.  

While using Jekyll you can develop or import basic components, add a few styling adjustments, build and maintain your website on top of it concentrating only on your raw data (for example, the content of your blogposts written in markdown files). In this respect, Jekyll is a great assistance in hosting your blog on a static web-server!


<blockquote>"Jekyll does what you tell it to do â€” no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold
    assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your
    way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content." (<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown">Jekyll's "README" file</a>)</blockquote>
