While setting up comments to my blogposts I used a feature-rich comment system completed with social network integration provided by Disqus.

<br>
Disqus is a networked community platform used by hundreds of thousands of sites all over the web.

<br>
Disqus provides very nice step-by-step instructions on how to install comment system on your website. 

<br>
All you need to do is to create an account on their platform, choose your personal plan (if you choose basic it is free) and install Disqus on your site while following the given instructions and adjusting personal configurations.
