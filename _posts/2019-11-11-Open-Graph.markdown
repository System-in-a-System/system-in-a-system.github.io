Open Graph is a protocol that allows web pages to be represented as items in a social graph. This technology was first introduced by Facebook in 2010. The purpose was to allow a better integration between Facebook and other websites by displaying rich graph objects with the same features as Facebook objects.

Nowadays Open Graph is held by the Open Web Fondation and being widely implemented on major social media platforms. When you see a link posted on those platform it usually includes not only url, but also an image, a title and a brief site description. You can easily configure what is to be displayed in the Open Graph for your site. 

Since social media platforms are the main medium for nowadays website traffic, it is important to use open graph for optimizing the sharings of your website on those platforms.
